# Secure Database Management System

A secure database management system that ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data. The system provides features such as authentication, access control, live helpline, encryption algorithms, approval/disapproval requests, and activity tracking/logs.

First of I make a database on mysql workbench. Then we use Python Flask integration to connect to the database and the html pages of our webapp. Then I just simply create the html, css, app.py, database tables and database connection. Just run it and u are done. Below are the screenshots of every page and working.
